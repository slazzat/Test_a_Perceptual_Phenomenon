# Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon
The project was performed as part of Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree program. 

In this project, I investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, will compute some statistics describing the results and interpret the results in terms of my hypotheses.
